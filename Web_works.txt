    What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
        Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
        Request headers: Host, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control

    What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
        Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
        Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser and other things)
        The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful or 404 if not found))
        The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
        The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each of them.
